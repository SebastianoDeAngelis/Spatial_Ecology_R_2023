# WGS: World Geodetic System
# coordynate system's EPSG is a code use by oil company to tag reference systems
# earth's surface isn't like the one of a geometrical sphere so  you nee other shapes to approximate it. a geoid is a 3d shape which surface is always perpendicular to the gravitational force which is difficult to estimate,
# an ellipsoide is a 3d ellipse. for many places you dont find an ellipsoid perfectly coinciding with the geoid we have different ellipsoids virtually built atop of earth's surface to better estimate earth's surface in a definite reference system


######## final exercise 
# import the green band from sentinel-2 (band 3)

b3 <- im.import("sentinel.dolomites.b3.tif")
clb <- colorRampPalette(c("darkgrey","grey","lightgrey","lightgrey3")) (100)
