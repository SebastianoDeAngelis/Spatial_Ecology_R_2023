#### Dispersion is the pattern of spacing among individuals within the boundaries of a population
#### Patterns of dispersion within a population can be: clumped, uniform, or randomic
#### Demography is the study of dynamics in a population, its individual's vital statistics (check for survivorship curve)
#### Carrying capacity is the amount of individuals of a population or species that can be sustained by the resources in the environmente
#### r species: selected for life cycle traits that maximie reproduction
#### K species: selected for life cycle traits that are related to higher competition
#### Metapopulations are groups of populations linked by immigration and emigration
#### Estimates on carrying capacity of humans on Earth tells is 10-15 billion
