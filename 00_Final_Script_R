# really dont be shy, just comment a lot

#make an array with data

Plas <- c(10, 20, 30, 50, 70) # number of microplastic found in a finnite area

People <- c(100, 500, 600, 1000, 2000) # number of people found in the determinate area

plot (People, Plas, xlab="number of people", ylab="microplastics)

#this makes it possible to add labels to graphs dimensions

#add point characters to graphs

plot (People, Plas, xlab="number of people", ylab="microplastics", pch=16, cex=0.4, col=blue)

# "pch" (point character) is for the shape, "cex" is for the size of dots in the plot, and "col" is for color

# 02_Population_Density

#### Populations: group of Individuals all attaining to the same species
#### Density number of individuals per unit area of a species, usually is an interplay between phonomenon that add individuals (birth, immigration) combined with individual removal (death or emigration)
#### Dispersion is the pattern of spacing among individuals within the boundaries of a population
#### Patterns of dispersion within a population can be: clumped, uniform, or randomic
#### Demography is the study of dynamics in a population, its individual's vital statistics (check for survivorship curve)
#### Carrying capacity is the amount of individuals of a population or species that can be sustained by the resources in the environmente
#### r species: selected for life cycle traits that maximie reproduction
#### K species: selected for life cycle traits that are related to higher competition
#### Metapopulations are groups of populations linked by immigration and emigration
#### Estimates on carrying capacity of humans on Earth tells is 10-15 billion
