# going thru ecological concepts:
    # ecological partitioning, ecological niches, ecological succession (primary, secundary), food chains and food webs, richness, absolute abundance and relative abundance. 
# multivariate analysis: create graphs and use as dimensions the plots of a survey.
# use principal components (1) to correlate variables in a graphs plotted using multivariate analysis, this technique is useful to see multiple points correlated with multiple dimensions (plots) in just a few dimension
